## 🧪 Testing the Rules

You can test the deployed rules using:

```bash
# Start Firebase emulator for local testing
firebase emulators:start --only firestore

# Test rules in Firebase Console
# Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/turbofy-tasks/firestore/rules
```

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Test Authentication Flow**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Visit http://localhost:3000 and test signup/login

2. **Create Test Data**
   - Sign up a test user
   - Create a team
   - Add some tasks
   - Test permissions

3. **Monitor Rules Performance**
   - Check Firebase Console for rule evaluation metrics
   - Monitor for permission denied errors
   - Optimize queries based on usage patterns

4. **Set Up Additional Firebase Services** (Optional)
   - Firebase Functions for server-side operations
   - Firebase Storage for file uploads
   - Firebase Hosting for deployment

## 🚨 Important Security Notes

- **Admin Role Assignment:** Currently done manually in Firestore Console
- **First User:** Make yourself admin by updating your user document
- **Team Ownership:** Team creators automatically become owners
- **Rule Updates:** Always test in emulator before deploying

## 📚 Documentation References

- **Security Rules:** See `SECURITY_RULES.md` for detailed documentation
- **API Services:** Check `src/services/` for interaction patterns
- **Type Definitions:** Review `src/types/index.ts` for data models

## 🔄 Future Deployments

To update rules or indexes:

```bash
